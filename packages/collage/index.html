        The parcels are managed by the Arizona State Land Department, a separate
        government agency that has leased portions of them to agriculture,
        grazing, and commercial activities. But extractive industries make up a
        major portion of the trust land portfolio. Of the 705,000 subsurface
        acres that benefit UArizona, almost 645,000 are earmarked for oil and
        gas production. The lands were taken from at least 10 Indigenous
        nations, almost all of which were seized by executive order or
        congressional action in the wake of warfare.

        Over the past year, Grist has examined publicly available data to locate
        trust lands associated with land-grant universities seeded by the
        Morrill Act. In the process, we identified their original sources and
        analyzed their ongoing uses. In all, we located and mapped more than 8.1
        million surface and subsurface acres taken from 123 Indigenous nations.
        This land currently produces income for 14 land-grant universities.

        “Universities continue to benefit from colonization,” said Sharon Stein,
        an assistant professor of higher education at the University of British
        Columbia and a climate researcher. “It’s not just a historical fact, the
        actual income of the institution is subsidized by this ongoing
        dispossession.”
      </p>
      <p>
        State agencies likewise receive and distribute the income. As money
        comes in, it is either delivered directly to beneficiaries or, more
        commonly, diverted to permanent state trust funds, which invest the
        proceeds and make scheduled payouts to support select public services
        and institutions.
      </p>

        These trusts have a fiduciary obligation to generate profit for
        institutions, not minimize environmental damage. Although some of the
        permitted activities are renewable and low-impact, others are quietly
        stripping the land. All of them fill public coffers with proceeds
        derived from ill-gotten resources.

        For a $10 fee last December, anyone in New Mexico could chop down a
        Christmas tree in a pine stand on a patch of state trust land just off
        Highway 120 near Black Lake, southeast of Taos. The rules: pay your fee,
        bring your permit, choose a tree, and leave nothing behind but a stump
        less than 6 inches high.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The holidays are a time we should be enjoying our loved ones, not
        worrying about the cost of providing a memorable experience for our
        kids,” said the Commissioner of Public Lands Stephanie Garcia Richard,
        adding that “the nominal fee it costs for a permit will directly benefit
        New Mexico public schools, so it supports a good cause too.” The offer
        has been popular enough to keep the program running for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The New Mexico State Land Office, sometimes described by state
        legislators as “the most powerful office you’ve never heard of,” has
        been a successful operation for a very long time. Since it started
        reporting revenue in 1900, it’s generated well over $42 billion in
        current dollars.
      </p>
      <p>All that money isn’t from Christmas trees.</p>
      <p>
        For generations, oil and gas royalties have fueled the state’s trust
        land revenue, with a portion of the funds designated for New Mexico
        State University, a land-grant school founded in 1888 when New Mexico
        was still a territory.
